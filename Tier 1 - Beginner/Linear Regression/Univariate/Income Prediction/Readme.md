# **Income Prediction - Univariate Project**

This project predicts income based on a single feature, using experience and test scores. It demonstrates basic machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, linear regression, and model evaluation.

## **Overview**
- **Goal**: Predict the income of an individual based on their experience and test scores.
- **Type**: Univariate Regression
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - `scikit-learn`: For building and evaluating the linear regression model.
  - `matplotlib`: For data Vizualization


## **How to Run**
1. Clone the repository and navigate into the project folder.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the model script `salary_predictor.py` to train and make predictions.

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn` , `matplotlib` 

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the model: You can run the model training and prediction script by executing:

```bash
Income Prediction/salary_predictor.py

```

## **Results**
The model uses linear regression to predict income based on experience and test scores. You can modify the input features (experience, test scores) in the script to test the model with different data points.

Stay tuned for updates as new features and improvements are added to this project!
